By analyzing the development of e-commerce and the application of computer vision in its industry, we simulated the scene that we plan to realize the function of optimizing product push by using face recognition and emotion recognition. We have achieved it step by step:

+ **`Face detection`**: the vision framework of Xcode is used to detect faces and calculate the number of faces;
+ **`Face classification`**: using the method of CreateML to train the model of image classification, and realize the classification of face categories in the image;
+ **`Face recognition`**: train marked datasets in three different ways and deploy them on IOS to realize face identification, and compare the performance of the three training models; 
+ **`Emotion detection`**: use CreateML to train expression data set, and deploy it on IOS to realize expression recognition; 
+ **`Mask detection`**: use CreateML to train mask data set and deploy it on IOS to detect whether to wear masks;
