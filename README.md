By analyzing the development of e-commerce and the application of computer vision in its industry, this project simulated the scene of optimizing commercial pushes by using face recognition and emotion recognition. The project was acheived by the following steps:

+ **`Face detection`**: Applied the vision framework of Xcode to detect faces and calculate the number of faces;
+ **`Face classification`**: Applied CreateML to train the model of image classification, and realize the classification of face categories in the image;
+ **`Face recognition`**: Marked datasets in three different labels and deployed them on IOS device to realize face identification, and compare the performance of the three training models; 
+ **`Emotion detection`**: Applied CreateML to train expression data set, and deployed it on IOS device to realize expression recognition; 
+ **`Mask detection`**: Applied CreateML to train mask data set and deployed it on IOS device to detect whether to wear masks;
